Here's a review of what we covered on February 24th.

Starting python with the 'python' command from a command prompt window.

The + (addition) and * (multiplication) operators on numbers and strings.

Using the range function to construct a list of integers.

using the len function to get the length of a list.

Using subscripts [] to get an element from a list.

Using print.

Order of operations (how * is "tighter" than +) and how to use
parentheses to control the order of operations.

tuples:

  subscripts work on tuples too

  a literal tuple with only one element still needs a comma so that it's
  not confused with a parenthesized expression.

The % formatting operator and using tuples to format several values
into the resulting string.

The type function tells you the type of its argument.

The dir function lists all of the properties of an object.

the help function enters the help facility where one can get
documentation about any defined python object.

Iteration using the for loop over a range.

Using a for loop we printed a table of the squares of numbers.

Printing a multiplication table.  See multiplication_table.py.
